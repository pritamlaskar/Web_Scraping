# Web_Scraping

**Web Scraping** is a powerful technique used to extract information and data from websites. It enables programmers and data enthusiasts to automate the process of retrieving valuable data from web pages, ultimately facilitating analysis, research, and various applications. One of the most popular tools for web scraping is BeautifulSoup, a Python library that simplifies the parsing of HTML and XML documents. In this article, we'll delve into the world of web scraping using BeautifulSoup and explore its capabilities, benefits, and common use cases.

**BeautifulSoup** acts as a bridge between the web page's source code and the developer's Python code. It allows users to navigate and search through the HTML structure of a webpage, identifying specific elements like headings, tables, paragraphs, and more. This makes it easier to extract desired information without manual copying and pasting.

This repository comprises the following projects:

â€¢ ***Web_Scraping-Largest-US-Companies***: The provided code extracts tabular data from a Wikipedia page, listing the largest US companies by revenue. It uses BeautifulSoup to parse the HTML and requests to fetch the page. It identifies a specific table and its headings, then creates a pandas DataFrame to store the extracted data. A loop processes each row, extracting individual cell data and appending it to the DataFrame. Finally, the DataFrame is exported as a CSV file.
